LISTAGG function in DBMS is used to aggregate strings from data in columns in a database table.

It makes it very easy to concatenate strings. It is similar to concatenation but uses grouping.
The speciality about this function is that, it also allows to order the elements in the concatenated list.
Syntax:

LISTAGG (measure_expr [, 'delimiter']) WITHIN GROUP 
(order_by_clause) [OVER query_partition_clause]
measure_expr : The column or expression to concatenate the values.
delimiter : Character in between each measure_expr, which is by default a comma (,) .
order_by_clause : Order of the concatenated values.
Let us have a table named Gfg having two columns showing the subject names and subject number that each subject belongs to, as shown below :

SQL> select * from GfG;

SUBNO      SUBNAME
---------- ------------------------------

D10        LinkedList
D20        Matrix
D10        String
D30        Graph
D20        Tree

11 rows selected.
Query 1: Write an SQL query using LISTAGG function to output the subject names in a single field with the values comma delimited.

SQL> SELECT LISTAGG(SubName, ' , ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY SubName) AS SUBJECTS
  2  FROM   GfG ;
Output:

SUBJECTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm , C , C++ , DBMS , DataStructure , Graph , LinkedList , Matrix , Python ,
String , Tree
Query 2: Write an SQL query to group each subject and show each subject in its respective department separated by comma with the help of LISTAGG function.

SQL> SELECT SubNo, LISTAGG(SubName, ' , ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY SubName) AS SUBJECTS
  2  FROM   GfG
  3  GROUP BY SubNo;
Output:

SUBNO      SUBJECTS
------     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D10	    LinkedList , String
D20         Algorithm , C++ , Matrix , Tree
D30         C , DBMS , DataStructure , Graph , Python
Query 3: Write an SQL query to show the subjects belonging to each department ordered by the subject number (SUBNO) with the help of LISTAGG function.

SQL> SELECT SubNo, LISTAGG(SubName, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY SubName) AS SUBJECTS
  2  FROM   GfG
  3  GROUP BY SubNo
  4  ORDER BY SubNo;
Output:

SUBNO        SUBJECTS
-----        --------------------------------
D10          LinkedList, String
D20          Algorithm, C++, Matrix, Tree
